# 1. Write a Python program to determine whether a student is eligible for a scholarship. 
# The scholarship should be granted if the student satisfies either of the following conditions: 
# a) The student has a CGPA of 8.5 or above and attendance of 85 percent or above. 
# b) The student has won a national-level competition. 
# The program should take CGPA, attendance percentage, and national-level competition status as input, 
# then display whether the student is eligible for the scholarship.

cgpa = float(input("Enter CGPA: "))
attendance = float(input("Enter attendance percentage: "))
competition = input("Won national level competition? (yes/no): ")

eligible = (cgpa >= 8.5 and attendance >= 85) or competition.lower() == "yes"

print("Eligible for scholarship:", eligible)
