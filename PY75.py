# 1. Write a Python program to input a student's marks in n consecutive tests and store them in a list. Find the longest consecutive sequence in which 
# each mark is strictly greater than the previous mark.
# Display the sequence, its length, and its starting and ending test numbers as a tuple. If multiple sequences have the same maximum length, 
# display the first one.
# Marks: [55, 60, 68, 62, 65, 70, 78, 74]
# Longest improving sequence: [62, 65, 70, 78]
# Number of tests: 4
# Test range: (4, 7)
# Conditions:
# • Accept at least one test.
# • Equal marks break the improving sequence.
# • Test numbers begin at 1.
# • Do not sort the list because the original test order matters.
